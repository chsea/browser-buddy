BrowserBuddy is an interactive emotion feedback app that analyzes a live video feed of the user and responds visually and aurally to the emotions that user is displaying. If you're not feeling any of our starter buddies, you can sign up and create your own custom buddy! Custom buddies respond using text-to-speech and user uploaded pictures.

BrowserBuddy can also upload to Slack a screen capture of any user who displays the "duck face" emotion. Don't worry, we've disabled this feature to protect guilty parties. :)
